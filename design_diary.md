This assignment posed to be more difficult than I initially expected, and although I was able to meet the basic requirements for the assignment, I was not particularly excited with my final product.

The music player can play and pause music, and the volume can be adjusted with a + and a - button. A few functions that I had trouble finding ways to impliment were the ability skip between playable songs in a folder, and a way to show that a song had been loaded/was playing.

I didn't include a gif with my final submission as it really doesn't show anything. There's no visual queue that anything is working, so a gif seemed a little bit pointless.
